#**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

Creating a repository on GitHub is rather simple. Firstly, it is important to understand what a repository is. A repository, or "repo" for short, is similar to a working directory (a folder) on your local computer, expect that it exists remotely on the web. In order to create a repo on GitHub, go to GitHub.com and click on the “+” in the upper-right hand corner of the page and click “New repository.” You should now be on the “Create a new repository” page. Assuming that you are the owner of the repo, name your repo, and select “Public” for your repo visibility. Add the desired license to the repo, and click “Create repository” to complete the form.

Cloning a repo is another way of saying that you are creating a local repo (the copy of the repo on your computer). This can be achieved via the command line. Open Terminal and check where you are via “pwd”. You should never clone a repo into another local GitHub repo (another repo on your computer), so always make sure that you are in the correct directory such as your Desktop or a phase-0 folder (which may contain other local repositories, but isn’t a repository itself). On GitHub, locate the URL of your forked repo and copy it to your clipboard. In Terminal, type “git clone [paste URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED]”, and hit Enter. To confirm that you have successfully created a local repo, execute the command “ls” and you should see the folder with the same name as the repo you cloned.

#**Describe what open source means.**
Open-source describes the sharing of how a computer program was made and allows anyone to customize the program as they see fit. GitHub is a place where developers can share their source code.

#**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
I think Open Source is a fantastic idea. It cultivates an environment that encourages creativity, innovation, and collaboration among programmers. The fact that open-source software relies heavily on lisencing is reassuring and definitely makes me less nervous. Licesnses, although sometimes minimally restrictive, establish a set of parameters regarding how a developer can use and distribute another developer's work.

#**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
Open-source software relies on the concept of content licensing, where a developer's code is accompanied by a set of regulations that grant specific permissions for others to use their work. It is a great alternative to simply releasing your work into the public domain or granting permissions on a case-by-case basis. The license which we have used thus far in our challenges, the MIT Licesne, contains very loose terminology and is the least restrictive license out there. It permits a developer to use, copy, and modify software however he/she wants. No one can prevent you from using the software on any project, from copying it however many times you want and in whatever format you like, or from changing it however you want. You can give the software away for free or sell it (i.e. – no restrictions on how to distribute it). In other words, the MIT License basically says that anyone can do whatever they want with the licensed material, as long as it’s accompanied by the license agreement.

#**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
After this challenge, my ability to navigate between GitHub (remote), Terminal (local), and Sublime (text editor) has certainly improved. I wouldn't say that I had any "aha" moments yet, but will continue to practice creating, forking, and cloning repositories, and learning the git terminology so that I become fluent in the various moving parts of version-control as soon as possible. Again, although my ability to work with GitHub and my local machine improved, I definitely still struggle with completing certain tasks in a timely and fluid manner.  

#**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
The resources provided were quite informative, and I didn't feel the need to continue researching beyond the listed websites.
