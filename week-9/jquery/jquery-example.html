<!-- 
What is jQuery?
jQuery is a library, or set of helpful add-ons, to JavaScript.

What does jQuery do for you?
jQuery provides a simple interface for the underlying JavaScript. It is much better at giving you immediate, visual results than regular JavaScript.

What did you learn about the DOM while working on this challenge?
The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the structure of an HTML document and consists of every element of that document, organized in a tree-like fashion. jQuery interacts with the DOM (elements on an HTML page) in order to gain access to and modify an HTML document.
