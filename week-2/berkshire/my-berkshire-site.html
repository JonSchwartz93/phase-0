<!-- 
	What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was exciting to translate my previous learning with HTML (primarily CodeAcademy) into an actual site. I found it extremely interesting to periodically open/refresh this HTML file in Google Chrome as my pair and I continued to add to and modify the code in order to witness our progress in real-time. I am looking forward to incorporating CSS into my arsenal so that I can tailor the website to be more visually appealing.

	How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	Most of the HTML5 elements that I used were the ones I learned about while completing the CodeAcademy tutorials (HTML Basics I-III). However, I didn't find it overly difficult to implement these elements into the cloning of the Berkshire Hathaway website.

	How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I attempted to abide by the HTML best practice standards as best I could. I implemented the changes as specified by the provided "HTML Validation Tool" until I received a message that read "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

	What seems good and bad about HTML?
	At least from what we've learned thus far, HTML seems like a relatively easy language to learn. Additonally, HTML has a wide variety of applications. Unfortunately, one downside to HTML is that it is used strictly for semantic purposes, and thus needs to be paired with a styling language (CSS) in order to make a webpage visually appealing.

	What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	One useful trick that I have for remembering how to write HTML is that when it comes to HTML tags, there should, for the most part, always be an opening and closing tag. There are certain exceptions of course (such as <img src="">), but more often than not, there are two components (open and close) to a line of HTML. Another trick I use for remembering how to write HTML is that I think about the layout of the webpage I am constructing prior to actually writing any HTML. The reason I do this is because HTML is used to describe the structure of a website semantically (semantic = meaning/signficance). In other words, one example of this would be that the items with an "<h1></h1>" heading are the most important topics to be discussed, while those with an "<h5></h5> or <h6></h6>" are less significant subtopics.
