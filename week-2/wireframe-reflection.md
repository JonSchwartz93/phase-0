<h1>What is a wireframe?</h1>
A wireframe is a diagram (it can be drawn with pen and paper or created online using one of a multitude of wireframing tools) that displays the functional elements of a website. This layout is used to plan a site's structure and functionality.

<h1>What are the benefits of wireframing?</h1>
A wireframe is beneficial because it provides a visual layout of what a website might look like. Wireframes focus on the range of functions available on said website and connects the flow of information presented on the site with the site's surface/visual design.

<h1>Did you enjoy wireframing your site?</h1>
I really enjoyed wireframing my site. Personally, it made my site almost come alive. I am getting increasingly excited to learn how to incorporate CSS into the site to make it truly visually appealing.

<h1>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?</h1>
I did in fact revise my wireframe. I initially had a layout that seemed a bit generic and pedestrian. Then, I thought to myself, "let me see if I can find some of the wireframe-indexes from past DBC students on GitHub." The examples I found were extremely helpful in exposing me to alternative ways to layout my website. 

<h1>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h1>
From the outset, I repeateedly asked myself how I want my website to look. Since it is a relatively basic, personal website with few complicated functions, I opted for a minimalist design so that the users attention is focused on my website's content ('About Me,' 'Projects,' 'Resume,' and 'Blog'). I found some great examples of website indexes by searching for the work of past DBC students. This opened my eyes to a number of concepts that I hadn't previously thought of. Another resource I used was Mockingbird, an online wireframing tool.

<h1>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?</h1>
I enjoyed nearly this entire challenge. It was great to wireframe my website and brainstorm ways that will optimize a user's experience when they visit my site.
