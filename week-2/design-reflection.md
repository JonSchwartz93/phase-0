<h2>What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?</h2>

**1) Information Gathering** -- This is the most important step. It involves a solid understanding of the company the website is created for and why the company needs that website. Do you want to provide information, promote a service, sell a product…? Who is the “ideal” person you want to visit your website (consider age, sex, or interests)?
**2) Planning** -- This is where a site-map is developed. A site-map is a list of all main topic areas of the site, as well as subtopics, if applicable. The goal of planning is to organize your website in a coherent manner so that the end user (your customer) can navigate seamlessly. 
**3) Design** -- In this step, the website designer incorporates company logos or colors to help strengthen the identity of your company on the website. The web designer will present mock versions of the website so that you can determine what you like/dislike.
**4) Development** -- The development stage is where the website itself is created. Here, the web designer employs his/her knowledge of HTML/CSS and makes sure that the website complies with current web standards and maximizes functionality and accessibility to as large an audience as possible.
**5) Testing and Delivery** -- During this phase, the web designer confirms that the code for your website is valid, meaning it meets the current web development standards. Additionally, the designer tests the website’s functionality on the most recent browser versions. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is also accomplished during this stage. This is the optimization of your website with elements such as title, description, and keyword tags which help your site achieve higher rankings among search engines (when somebody searches for your website, it will appear near the top). This stage marks the official launch of your website. It is now viewable to the public!
**6) Maintenance** -- Adding new pages and revising old ones, or offering new content or products on a regular basis requires modifying the website itself. This can be done via a Content Management System (CMS) such as Word Press. Often times when a business owner is extremely busy with the day-to-day operations of their company, they transfer the role of website maintenance to the site's designer.

<h2>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</h2>

The primary purpose of my profesisonal website is to share my work history, background, passions, past projects, and a blog with potential employers and people interested in networking/getting in contact with me. My site will feature alot of the content that is present on my resume (i.e. -education, work experience, projects, interests/passions), but in a more visually appealing fashion.

<h2>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</h2>

My target audience (potential employers) are seeking  ambititous and creative web developers/software engineers. My site will showcase my skills and past projects in order to address their need for a new addition to their team (me!).

<h2>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</h2>

The primary "actions" the user should take when visiting my site include viewing my prior experiences, my portfolio of projects, and once this has been done, view my "Contact Information" page in order to reach out to me regarding potential job opportunities.

<h2>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h2>

User Experience (UX) is how a person feels when interacting with a system. UX designers study and evaluate how users feel about a system, and focus on concepts including ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks, etc. User-centered design, a recent phenomenon is a concept whereby design should be based on the needs and wants of users. Because websites have become increasingly complex and feature-rich, they must have great user experience designs. It is important to note, however, that UX design cannot accomplish certain things. UX design is not one size fits all. In other words, what works for one person might have the opposite effect on another. The best we can do is design for specific experiences and promote certain behaviors, but we can’t manufacture, impose or predict the actual experience itself. Additionally, there is no great way of measuring user experience because UX is highly subjective. It deals with users’ emotions and you cannot quanitify emotions the way you can with page views, bounce rate, or conversion.

<h2>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h2>
There is one minor part of this challenge that I found tedious, and has to do with the two questions prior to this one. "What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?" and "What is user experience design and why is it valuable?" are essentially the same question, are they not? Otherwise, this assignment was actually a great learning experience because UX design is entirely new to me. It was fascinating to learn about the reasoning behind why websites are organized in a certain way.
