// Person 1: Tests to User Stories

// SUM:

// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even

//Pseudocode:




//Initial Solution:




// MEAN:
// As a user, I want to create a Function called "mean" 
// that returns the mean of a group of numbers. The 
// mean should be returned in two scenarios: when the 
// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even 
// amount of numnbers.

//Pseudocode:




//Initial Solution:




// MEDIAN:
// As a user, I want to create a Function called "median" 
// that returns the median of a group of numbers. The 
// median should be returned in two scenarios: when the 
// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even 
// amount of numnbers.
