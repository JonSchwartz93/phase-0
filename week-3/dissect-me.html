			        Hello readers! My name is Jon and my first week at Dev Bootcamp (DBC) is quickly winding down. I have learned a lot in only a short period of time and I thought I’d share some of the important takeaways I’ve gleaned thus far in Phase 0.

			        The week kicked off by learning about a computer’s command line interface (CLI). Most people interact directly with their computer through the graphical user interface (GUI) – the various graphical icons and visual symbols present on a computer (e.g. – folders, files, application icons, etc.) The CLI, on the other hand, is an alternative way to interact with your computer by executing commands in the computer’s command line interpreter (aka terminal), or “shell.” A shell is a user interface (such as bash, a Unix shell and command language, which serves as the default shell on Mac OS X) that grants an individual the ability to interact with an operating system’s services. In other words, the shell is a software program that interprets commands from the user so that a computer’s operating system can perform certain functions. Learning how to navigate the command line is essential in programming efficiently and effectively.
